Solana App with Rust Program


1. Change the network like so:
solana config set --url localhost

2. Start the local network. This is going to be a local Solana node that we can deploy to for testing:
solana-test-validator

3. Once the local network is running, you can airdrop tokens to your account. With the network running, open a separate window and run the following command:
solana airdrop 100
